## Description

**Professional 3D Geometry Educational App** is an interactive web application built with **Babylon.js**.  
It allows you to explore, import, and export a variety of 3D geometric shapes while adjusting parameters like scale, translation, lighting, material properties, camera settings, and animations—all in real time. 😎

---

## Features

- **Interactive Shape Selection**  
  Choose from standard shapes (Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Torus, Cone) and advanced polyhedra (Tetrahedron, Octahedron, Dodecahedron, Icosahedron) as well as additional solids (Ellipsoid, Pyramid, Prism, Hyperboloid, Torus Knot) and even build your custom shape.

- **Dynamic Controls**  
  - **Color & Material:** Real-time updates of object color, specular, and emissive properties.  
  - **Scale & Translation:** Adjust the object's size and position along the X, Y, and Z axes.  
  - **Lighting:** Modify scene light intensity and color.  
  - **Animation:** Toggle auto‑rotation and adjust rotation speed.  
  - **Camera:** Fine-tune camera parameters including alpha, beta, and radius.

- **Import/Export Support**  
  Import external 3D objects (e.g., GLTF, GLB, OBJ, STL) and export your current scene in various formats such as OBJ and GLTF/GLB. Also, download screenshots as PNG images.

- **Presets**  
  Quickly switch among several preset configurations (Default, Night Mode, Bright Day, Warm) for effortless theme changes.
